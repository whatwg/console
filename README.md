# Console Specification

For several users most web browsers have shipped some form of JavaScript developer console.
Unfortunately, without a standard specification, each browser has implemented the language bindings of this console differently, a list containing some of the differences is available in the [NOTES.md](NOTES.md).

This specification aims to standardize and extend the current web browser behavior.

## WIP

This specification is still in its very early stages.
It is very much a work in progress.

## The Specification

The Console Specification is written in [`Bikeshed`](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed) and is tracked in this repository as `index.bs`.
The latest rendered version can be viewed at <https://whatwg.github.io/console>.
